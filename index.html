  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <img src="MedhasreeGhosh%20Pic.jpeg" alt="Medhasree Ghosh">

  <p>
    I’m <strong>Dr. Medhasree Ghosh</strong>, a researcher in Computer Science and Engineering at the 
    <strong>Indian Institute of Technology Patna</strong>, where I explore the fascinating crossroads 
    of <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain</strong>. My research focuses on 
    designing interpretable deep learning frameworks to detect and mitigate security threats in 
    decentralized ecosystems — because if machines can think, they might as well think securely.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s my long-term dream to establish my own research lab and contribute to academia both as a 
    dedicated teacher and an inspiring research mentor, nurturing minds, ideas, and maybe even a 
    few coffee addictions along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the academic realm, I am proudly a foodie with a research-level curiosity for flavors. 
    I run my Instagram food page 
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/check_n_eat_with_mg/" target="_blank"><strong>@check_n_eat_with_mg</strong></a>, 
    where algorithms pause and calories take charge — from street food experiments to fine dining stories.
    When not chasing food trails, I find peace in photography, reflective writing, and the quiet company 
    of nature. I am a true believer of <strong>GOD and KARMA</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, to be honest, I am one of those lucky ones who found her profession as her passion — and never stopped loving it.
  </p>

  <div class="quote">
    “Goodness is the truest form of wisdom — for what we give to the world through honesty and empathy 
    is what the universe returns to us.”  
    <br><strong>— Medhasree</strong>
